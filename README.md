# R2Net-Residual-Refinement-Network-for-Salient-Object-Detection
This repo. is an implementation of R2Net, which is accepted for in Image and Vision Computing.

## Paper
The paper will come soon.

## Saliency maps
you can find the saliency maps on DUTS-TE、ECSSD、HKU-IS、DUT-OMRON and PASCAL-S datasets and the weight pth file from Google Driver link (coming soon) and the Baidu online disk link (coming soon)

We use the code provided by this [repo.](https://github.com/Mehrdad-Noori/Saliency-Evaluation-Toolbox) to calculate the metrics

## Results
The effect of R^2Net on 5 benchmark datasets is as follows, we achieve a SOTA results than any existing SOD methods.
